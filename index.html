                                        Hi Deon, thank you for taking up this mission to choreograph and teach us the dance.
                                        It must not have been easy to teach all of us, ensure that we are ready to perform in such a short timeframe, and manage the PDs during training sessions. Thank you so much for your efforts! You have
                                        really done a great job!

                                        Hey Deon! Thank you for making me love dance more! Initially I was afraid to join this segment as I am a slow learner and am thus scared that I wouldn’t be able to catch up & remember all the dance
                                        steps. But when you started teaching the steps, I felt so assured and grateful because the patience you had and guidance you gave to the group aided me in grasping the steps well. Thank you for your
                                        consistent efforts as a choreographer and a trainer! I have always looked forward to every week’s training, eager to learn new steps and to see how the final product will turn out, i will miss this

Know it wasn’t easy for you to take on this role, (especially when all the ics all damn busy and you have to tank everything) I know it isn’t easy taking care of the kids as well, but you did a great job and your patience paid off! Hope we can meet again soon! Maybe both of us become participants the next time then we can talk to each other more!!

We had a lot of fun, and it's amazing we can learn the choreography in such a short span of time. We hope to participate again next year! We will definitely miss the weekly training sessions! And thank you for the thoughtfulness and effort in writing the encouragement notes and the goodie bags! ♥️
